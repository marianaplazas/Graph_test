In the f_rutas.py file, there is an algorithm of its own that calculates all possible routes recursively and their respective weight, finally returning the best route

In the node.c file, there is a code that is under construction and modification to understand the graphs in C as linked lists are not finished and implement the DFS algorithm to determine the nodes viewed along with the node.h library that is part of this work with C. It should be clarified that the original code is not it's own and is only used as a basis to understand the construction of graphs

finally, the input.txt file is the file with the vertices, edges and the path to calculate that is used as a test for the implementations.
